## üî¥ Critical Issue: Blog Post Canonical Tags (FIXED)

### Problem
All 4 blog posts were marked as "Non-Indexable" with status "Canonicalised" because their canonical tags pointed to `.html` versions while the actual URLs served were clean URLs without extensions.

### Affected URLs
1. `https://recho.co/blog/what-is-a-good-reddit-cpc-in-2025`
2. `https://recho.co/blog/what-new-reddit-ad-tools-launched-in-2025`
3. `https://recho.co/blog/how-to-build-an-engaged-reddit-community`
4. `https://recho.co/blog/why-your-reddit-strategy-is-failing`

### Root Cause
```html
<!-- BEFORE (Wrong) -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.recho.co/blog/what-is-a-good-reddit-cpc-in-2025.html">

<!-- AFTER (Fixed) -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.recho.co/blog/what-is-a-good-reddit-cpc-in-2025">
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Search engines saw these pages as canonical redirects to `.html` versions, marking them as non-indexable
- **After**: Canonical tags now match actual URL structure, allowing proper indexing

### Solution Applied
‚úÖ Updated all 4 blog post canonical tags to point to clean URLs without `.html` extensions  
‚úÖ Matches hosting configuration that serves clean URLs with 308 redirects from `.html` versions

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior: 308 Redirects

### Finding
Multiple `.html` URLs show "308 Permanent Redirect" status, redirecting to clean URLs.

### Examples
- `https://recho.co/index.html` ‚Üí `https://recho.co/` (308)
- `https://recho.co/services.html` ‚Üí `https://recho.co/services` (308)
- `https://recho.co/blog/what-is-a-good-reddit-cpc-in-2025.html` ‚Üí `https://recho.co/blog/what-is-a-good-reddit-cpc-in-2025` (308)

### Status
‚úÖ **This is CORRECT behavior** - Your hosting is properly configured to redirect `.html` URLs to clean URLs. This is SEO best practice.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issue: 404 Errors

### Finding
Two URLs returning 404 Not Found:
1. `https://recho.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection`
2. `https://www.recho.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection`

### Analysis
‚úÖ **Not Concerning** - These are Cloudflare email protection obfuscation URLs that appear in HTML source but aren't meant to be directly accessible. They're placeholder URLs that get decoded by JavaScript.

### Status
No action needed - this is normal Cloudflare behavior.

---

## ‚úÖ Main Pages: All Indexable

### Status Overview

| Page | Status | Title Length | Meta Description Length | H1 Present |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------------|------------|
