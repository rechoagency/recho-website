## 📈 Site-Wide Health Check

### **Overall Statistics**

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total URLs Crawled | 54 | ✅ |
| HTML Pages | 22 | ✅ |
| **Indexable Pages** | **28** | ✅ |
| Non-Indexable | 26 | ⚠️ (Expected) |

### **Non-Indexable Breakdown**

| Type | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Redirects | 20 | ✅ Expected (`.html` → clean URLs) |
| Client Errors (404) | 2 | ℹ️ Cloudflare email protection URLs |
| Canonicalised | 4 | ⚠️ See note below |

**Note on "Canonicalised" URLs**: 
The 4 canonicalised URLs are the **non-www versions** (`recho.co/blog/*`), which properly redirect to the **www versions** (`www.recho.co/blog/*`). This is **correct behavior** - they point to the canonical www URLs.

**The important fix**: The **www.recho.co/blog/* URLs** (primary versions) are now **"Indexable"** with correct canonical tags. ✅

## 🔍 Minor Observations

### ⚠️ Expected Issues (Not Problems)

1. **404 Errors on Cloudflare Email Protection URLs**
   - Status: Not concerning
   - Reason: These are placeholder URLs for email obfuscation
   - Action: None needed

2. **20 Redirect URLs**
   - Status: Expected behavior
   - Reason: Clean URL redirects from `.html` versions
   - Action: None needed (this is correct)

3. **4 Canonicalised URLs (non-www)**
   - Status: Expected behavior
   - Reason: `recho.co` redirects to `www.recho.co`
   - Action: None needed (proper canonical setup)

### 💡 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Increase Inlinks to Blog Posts**
   - Current: Blog posts show 0 inlinks in crawl
   - Reason: Crawler may not have detected all links yet
   - Suggestion: Re-crawl in 24-48 hours to confirm internal links are detected

2. **Add More Internal Links**
   - Consider linking from homepage to featured blog posts
   - Add blog post links in FAQ answers where relevant
