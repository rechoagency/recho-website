## üìã CHECKLIST BEFORE TESTING

- [ ] Upload index.html to live website
- [ ] Upload services.html to live website
- [ ] Upload technology.html to live website
- [ ] Upload faq.html to live website
- [ ] Upload contact.html to live website
- [ ] Upload blog.html to live website
- [ ] Upload all 4 blog post HTML files to live website

---

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDER

**These fixes ONLY exist in local files at `/home/user/webapp/`**

Google Rich Results Test will continue showing the SAME OLD ERRORS until you:
1. Upload the fixed files to your live website
2. Test the LIVE URLs (not local file paths)

The schemas are perfect in these local files. They just need to be on your live site for Google to see them.
