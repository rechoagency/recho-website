## 2. ✅ Hero Icon Improvement (COMPLETED)

### Previous Design
- Single chart-line icon (fas fa-chart-line)
- Too simple, didn't convey multi-dimensional services

### New Design
Three icons representing:
- **Community** (fas fa-users) - Organic community building
- **Growth** (fas fa-arrow-trend-up) - Performance and scale
- **Technology** (fas fa-microchip) - Proprietary tech platform

**Implementation**:
```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-center mb-6">
    <i class="fas fa-users text-5xl opacity-90"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-trend-up text-6xl mx-4 opacity-90"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-microchip text-5xl opacity-90"></i>
</div>
```

## 3. ✅ Statistics Updates (COMPLETED)

### A. "51% Purchase Discussions" - CLARIFIED

**Problem**: User didn't understand what this meant

**Research Finding**: 
- Official Reddit Inc. data (June 2024)
- Means: 51% of purchase-related CONVERSATIONS happen on Reddit
- NOT 51% of purchases themselves

**Hero Stats Update**:
- Changed: "% Purchase Discussions"
- To: "#1 Product Discussion Platform"

**Platform Stats Section**:
- Changed: "Purchase Discussions"
- To: "Online Purchase Conversations"
- Added context: "Happen on Reddit (Reddit Inc.)"

---

### B. "40% AI/LLM Citations" - REPLACED WITH CURRENT DATA

**Problem**: User said "I think as of this month it's closer to 5%" ✓ CORRECT

**Research Findings (October 2025)**:
- August 2025: 40% (peak - OpenAI deal)
- September 2025: 9.7% (declining)
- October 2025: ~2% (current)
- Reason: Google algorithm changes and access restrictions

**Homepage Change**:
- REMOVED: "40% AI/LLM Citations"
- REPLACED WITH: "#2 Most Visible in Google"
- Context: "1,328% SEO visibility growth"

**FAQ Page Update**:
Updated entire LLM section with accurate current data:
- Removed claim of "40% of all LLM citations"
- Added: "citations ranging from 2-10% depending on query type"
- Emphasized Reddit's real strength: "#1 platform for authentic product discussions"
- Kept GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) positioning
