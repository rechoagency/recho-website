## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Schema Placement Strategy
- **Main @graph**: Contains Organization, WebSite, WebPage, and page-specific schemas
- **Top-level Offers**: Separate `<script>` tags for better Google detection
- **All schemas**: Placed before closing `</body>` tag (except technology.html which has them after JS)

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Full Organization schema** on every page with:
   - Complete ImageObject for logo
   - ContactPoint with email
   - PostalAddress
   - sameAs (LinkedIn)
   - areaServed
   - knowsAbout (on homepage)

2. **WebSite schema** on every page referencing Organization as publisher

3. **WebPage/specific page types** with:
   - Proper @id references
   - isPartOf pointing to WebSite
   - about pointing to Organization
   - primaryImageOfPage pointing to logo

4. **ISO 8601 datetime format** on all blog posts with timezone

5. **Service schemas** instead of Product (correct for agency offerings)

6. **Offer schemas** with proper Service itemOffered structure

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Blog Posts Truncation - FIXED
**Problem**: All 4 blog posts were truncated mid-schema (missing closing tags)
**Solution**: Completed BreadcrumbList, added FAQPage schemas, restored closing tags
**Result**: All blog posts now complete with 3 valid schema blocks each

### 2. Missing Core Schemas - FIXED
**Problem**: Not all pages had Organization, WebSite, WebPage schemas
**Solution**: Added complete @graph with all required schemas to every page
**Result**: Every page now has consistent core schemas

### 3. Offer Schemas Not Detected - FIXED
**Problem**: Offers in @graph weren't appearing as separate items in Google
**Solution**: Created 3 separate top-level `<script>` blocks per Offer
**Result**: Homepage and services now have 3 detectable Offer schemas each

### 4. Technology Page Product Schema - FIXED
**Problem**: Had inappropriate Product schema for service offerings
**Solution**: Removed Product, kept only SoftwareApplication without price
**Result**: Clean SoftwareApplication schema with feature list

### 5. Contact Page Missing ContactPage - FIXED
**Problem**: Had ContactPoint but no ContactPage type
**Solution**: Added ContactPage to @graph
**Result**: Contact page now has proper ContactPage schema

### 6. FAQ Page Missing WebSite - FIXED
**Problem**: FAQ page didn't have WebSite schema
**Solution**: Added WebSite to @graph after Organization
**Result**: FAQ page now has complete schema structure
