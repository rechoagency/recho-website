# Schema.org Implementation Fixes - October 27, 2025

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. Blog Post JSON Syntax Error ✅
**Problem**: Trailing comma after "about" array causing "Missing '}' or object member name" error
**Solution**: Removed trailing comma from all 4 blog post files
**Files Fixed**:
- blog/how-to-build-an-engaged-reddit-community.html
- blog/why-your-reddit-strategy-is-failing.html
- blog/what-is-a-good-reddit-cpc-in-2025.html
- blog/what-new-reddit-ad-tools-launched-in-2025.html

### 2. Offer Schemas Not Showing Up ✅
**Problem**: Offer schemas were in <head> section, Google might not detect them properly
**Solution**: Moved 3 Offer schemas to end of <body> section (before closing </body>)
**Files Fixed**:
- index.html (3 Offer schemas)
- services.html (3 Offer schemas)

**Offer Schemas Now Include**:
1. Reddit Organic Management
2. Reddit Paid Advertising
3. EchoMind Technology Platform

### 3. Missing Core Schemas on All Pages ✅
**Problem**: Not all pages had Organization, WebSite, and WebPage schemas

- **All 4 blog posts**: Organization, BlogPosting, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage (3 Q&A each)
