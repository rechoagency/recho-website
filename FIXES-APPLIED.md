### **2. Contact Form Not Sending Emails** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Form had placeholder `YOUR_FORM_ID` and didn't send submissions

- Form now sends directly to: **sales@recho.co**
- Added anti-spam honeypot field
- Added success redirect after submission
- Professional email template (table format)

**How it works:**
1. User fills out form on recho.co/contact.html
2. FormSubmit sends email to sales@recho.co
3. **IMPORTANT:** First submission requires email confirmation
   - FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to sales@recho.co
   - Click the confirmation link in that email
   - After confirmation, all future submissions work automatically

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (requires one-time email confirmation)
