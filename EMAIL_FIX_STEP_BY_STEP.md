# üìß Email Deliverability Fix - Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Your Mission:** Check your DNS records and Google Workspace settings so I can tell you exactly what to fix.

---

## üéØ **STEP 1: Check Your Cloudflare DNS Records**

### **What to do:**

1. **Open your web browser**

2. **Go to this URL:**
   ```
   https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   ```

3. **Log in** with your Cloudflare account

4. **You'll see a list of domains**
   - Find and **click on: recho.co**

5. **On the left sidebar, click: DNS**
   - This shows all your DNS records

6. **Now, look through the list and find these:**

---

### **A. Look for MX Records** (Mail Exchange)

**What to look for:**
- Rows where the **Type** column says **"MX"**
- Should be pointing to Google servers

**What to tell me:**
- Do you see any MX records? (Yes/No)
- If yes, how many?
- What do they point to? (Copy the "Content" column values)

**Example of what you should see:**
```
Type: MX | Name: recho.co | Content: ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM | Priority: 1
Type: MX | Name: recho.co | Content: ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM | Priority: 5
```

---

### **B. Look for TXT Records** (Text records for email authentication)

**What to look for:**
- Rows where the **Type** column says **"TXT"**

**What to tell me - Copy and paste any TXT records that contain:**
1. **SPF record** - Contains text like: `v=spf1`
2. **DKIM record** - Name contains: `google._domainkey`
3. **DMARC record** - Name is: `_dmarc` or contains `_dmarc`
4. **Google verification** - Contains: `google-site-verification`

**Example of what you might see:**
```
Type: TXT | Name: @ | Content: "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
Type: TXT | Name: google._domainkey | Content: "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=..."
Type: TXT | Name: _dmarc | Content: "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine..."
```

### **C. Screenshot (Optional but Helpful)**

If it's easier, take a screenshot of your DNS records page and share it with me.

## üéØ **STEP 2: Check Google Workspace DKIM Status**

### **What to do:**

1. **Open a new browser tab**

2. **Go to this URL:**
   ```
   https://admin.google.com/
   ```

3. **Log in** with your Google Workspace admin account
   - This is usually your @recho.co email address
   - You need admin privileges

4. **Once logged in, look at the left sidebar**
   - Find and click: **Apps**

5. **You'll see a list of Google apps**
   - Find and click: **Google Workspace**

6. **Then click: Gmail**

7. **Scroll down and click: "Authenticate email"**
   - This might also say "Email authentication" or similar

8. **You should now see DKIM settings**

**What to tell me:**
- What does the status say?
  - "Not set up"
  - "Authenticating email"
  - "Authentication successful"
  - Something else?
- Do you see a button that says "Generate new record"?
- Do you see any DNS record information displayed?

---

## üéØ **STEP 3: Send a Test Email**

### **What to do:**

1. **Open Gmail** (using your @recho.co email)

2. **Send a test email to yourself** at a personal Gmail account
   - Subject: "Test Email"
   - Body: "Testing email deliverability"
   - Send it

3. **Open that personal Gmail account**

4. **Check where the email landed:**
   - ‚úÖ Inbox (good!)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Spam folder (this is the problem)
   - ‚ùå Didn't receive it at all (bigger problem)

**What to tell me:**
- Where did it land? (Inbox, Spam, or Didn't receive)

---

### **If you received the email (in Inbox OR Spam):**

5. **Open the email**

6. **Click the three dots** (‚ãÆ) in the top right corner

7. **Click: "Show original"**
   - A new tab opens with technical email details

8. **Look for these lines** (near the top):

```
SPF: PASS
DKIM: PASS  
DMARC: PASS
```

**What to tell me:**
- Copy and paste the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC lines
- Do they say "PASS" or "FAIL" or something else?

---

## üìù **STEP 4: Share Your Findings With Me**

Once you complete Steps 1-3, reply with:

### **From Step 1 (Cloudflare DNS):**
```
MX Records: [Yes/No, how many, what they point to]

TXT Records:
- SPF: [copy the record content or say "Not found"]
- DKIM: [copy the record content or say "Not found"]  
- DMARC: [copy the record content or say "Not found"]
```

### **From Step 2 (Google Workspace):**
```
DKIM Status: [what you see in Google Admin]
```

### **From Step 3 (Test Email):**
```
Email landed in: [Inbox / Spam / Didn't receive]

Authentication results:
- SPF: [PASS / FAIL / Not shown]
- DKIM: [PASS / FAIL / Not shown]
- DMARC: [PASS / FAIL / Not shown]
```

## üöÄ **What Happens Next**

Once you share this info with me, I will:

1. ‚úÖ **Immediately diagnose** what's missing or misconfigured
2. ‚úÖ **Give you exact DNS records** to add in Cloudflare (copy & paste ready)
3. ‚úÖ **Walk you through enabling DKIM** in Google Workspace (if needed)
4. ‚úÖ **Verify everything is fixed** and emails land in inbox
