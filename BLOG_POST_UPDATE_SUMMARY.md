### ✅ Content Length - Reduced by 50%

**Before:** 41KB (~3,500 words)
**After:** 35KB (~1,750 words)

**Sections removed or condensed:**
1. ❌ Removed detailed "High-Level Takeaways" box (too prescriptive)
2. ❌ Removed step-by-step "How to reach out" template (proprietary knowledge)
3. ❌ Removed detailed "Deliver Value" section (RECHO service details)
4. ❌ Removed extensive "Common Mistakes" list (too comprehensive)
5. ❌ Removed "Building Long-Term Relationships" details (strategy we charge for)
6. ❌ Removed extensive FAQ section (cut from 5 Q&As to 3)

**Sections kept:**
1. ✅ "Why moderators actually matter" (teaser)
2. ✅ "The foundation: participation before promotion" (overview only)
3. ✅ "How to actually reach out" (general guidance, not specifics)
4. ✅ "What happens when you get it wrong" (warning/consequences)
5. ✅ "Building relationships that last" (high-level only)
6. ✅ "The reality check" (emphasis on difficulty, leads to RECHO)
7. ✅ Simplified FAQ (3 questions instead of 5)

### ✅ Strategy Details - Made More Vague

**Changed approach:**
- ❌ Removed specific timeframes ("weeks or months" → just "takes time")
- ❌ Removed detailed modmail template example
- ❌ Removed specific tactics for building participation history
- ❌ Removed tactical advice on what to share
- ❌ Removed specific metrics to track
- ❌ Removed detailed culture rules checklist
- ✅ Kept warnings about what NOT to do (creates fear/urgency)
- ✅ Emphasized difficulty and complexity (positions RECHO as solution)
- ✅ Maintained "leave them wanting more" approach

### ✅ RECHO Positioning - Stronger CTA

**Updated approach:**
- Removed detailed strategy explanations that give away methodology
- Emphasized that this work requires expertise and relationships
- Highlighted that RECHO has "spent years building relationships with Reddit moderators"
- Positioned RECHO as having insider access ("we know which communities are open")
- Stronger CTA: "Talk to Our Team" instead of generic contact
- Clear value prop: "when you show up on Reddit correctly, the results speak for themselves"

### Conversion Strategy
1. **Hook:** Most brands get this completely wrong

3. **Obstacle:** This is harder than you think
4. **Consequence:** Get it wrong and you're permanently banned
5. **Tease:** There's a right way to do this
6. **Authority:** RECHO has spent years building these relationships
7. **CTA:** Talk to our team (positioned as experts with insider access)
